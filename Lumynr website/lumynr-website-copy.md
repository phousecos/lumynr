# ABOUT PAGE (/about)

## Founder Story Section

**Headline:**
Meet Dr. Jerri Bland

**[PLACEHOLDER - To be written by founder. Suggested structure below:]**

[Opening hook - a specific moment or realization that sparked Lumynr]

After 25+ years in IT leadership, I've been the only Black woman in the room more times than I can count. I've navigated the politics, proven my expertise over and over, and built a career I'm proud of. But I've also felt the isolation that comes with being "the only."

[Middle section - the gap she identified, the problem she wanted to solve]

I started looking for communities where Black women in IT could connect, learn, and support each other. What I found was either too broad, too corporate, or simply didn't exist. So I built it.

[Lumynr's purpose and vision]

Lumynr is the community I wish I'd had throughout my career. A place where Black women in IT can show up fully, learn from each other, and build the careers we deserve—without code-switching, without explaining ourselves, without navigating alone.

[Personal note and invitation]

This isn't just a membership platform to me. It's a movement. And I'd be honored to have you be part of it.

— Dr. Jerri Bland, Ed.D.
Founder, Lumynr

# NOTES FOR REVIEW

1. **Founder Story:** The placeholder above is a suggested structure. Jerri should write this in her own voice—it's the most important piece of authentic content on the site.

2. **Tone Check:** All copy aims for warm, confident, welcoming—not corporate. Review for anything that feels too stiff.

3. **Inclusive Language:** "Black women" is used consistently per Jerri's positioning. The self-identification checkbox provides space for members to confirm fit.

4. **CTA Consistency:** Primary CTAs use "→" arrows; secondary CTAs are text links. Adjust based on final design.

5. **Email Templates:** These can be customized in Stripe (for billing emails) or whatever email system handles invitation service notifications.
