# ABOUT PAGE (/about)

## Founder Story Section

**Headline:**
Meet Dr. Jerri Bland

**[PLACEHOLDER - To be written by founder. Suggested structure below:]**

[Opening hook - a specific moment or realization that sparked Lumynr]

After 25+ years in IT leadership, I've been the only Black woman in the room more times than I can count. I've navigated the politics, proven my expertise over and over, and built a career I'm proud of. But I've also felt the isolation that comes with being "the only."

[Middle section - the gap she identified, the problem she wanted to solve]

I started looking for communities where Black women in IT could connect, learn, and support each other. What I found was either too broad, too corporate, or simply didn't exist. So I built it.

[Lumynr's purpose and vision]

Lumynr is the community I wish I'd had throughout my career. A place where Black women in IT can show up fully, learn from each other, and build the careers we deserve—without code-switching, without explaining ourselves, without navigating alone.

[Personal note and invitation]

This isn't just a membership platform to me. It's a movement. And I'd be honored to have you be part of it.

— Dr. Jerri Bland, Ed.D.
Founder, Lumynr
